goals --- What we want it to do


main interface -- you should pick a date and card data is returned

get key # ...see notes parse date numerals and perform math function to get key number

key returns object data of card, color, solomon code number

need function to return color for selected card
need function to return solomon code for selected card

need function to generate solomon code for selected card

card, color, and solomon code will alsways be paired together. and will always call the same information
ex. call position 9, returns card name, color, and solomon code for that card.
secondary generate each for a date range


solomon code is ===
    1. select card
    2. determine the card position number
    3. find 3 other kings, 7s, etc
    4. determine positoning of the other three
    5. arrange all 4 cards into CHSD
    6. use stack position, use next card in chase sequence
    7. use next three card's position numbers in CHSD sequence
    8. last number is the face value of the original card






refactor to use with other stacks (to do later)
-- REDFORD STACK EXAMPLE --
need stack object with keys of card name, position, CHSD positioning


-- Color Reference Chart --
created in colors.json database
